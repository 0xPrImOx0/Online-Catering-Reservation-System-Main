# Online Catering Reservation System (Mobile Version)

## Project Info

This project is a companion app connected to the main [Online Catering Reservation System](https://github.com/0xPrImOx0/Online-Catering-Reservation-System.git). This mobile version syncs with the web-based system to ensure real-time updates and a smooth booking experience.

## Project Overview

The Online Catering Reservation System simplifies event booking for customers while providing caterers with an efficient way to manage reservations, payments, and menu offerings. Customers can browse menus, book catering services, and track their reservations, while caterers handle incoming orders, monitor payments, and schedule events. This system ensures a smooth transaction process between both parties with an intuitive dashboard and automated notifications.
